To be able to run the tests, you must have test framework libraries compatible with your version of Dart SDK. When you cannot run the tests, try following:
- update Dart SDK to latest stable version
- update test framework libraries in third_party/ from http://dart.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dart/client/testing/unittest/
